# A Quick Introduction To Sinatra

## What Is Sinatra?

"Sinatra is a free and open source software web application library and domain-specific language written in Ruby." -Wikipedia

The focus of Sinatra is to allow you to quickly get a website up and running with minimal effort.

There is no real structure of where you put the front end materials (HTML, JS, CSS), the models, or the controller. You can leave everything in the root folder. The models and controller can be in the same file since they are both written in Ruby.

But for the sake of good practice, we will split it up so it'll be easy to find something when you want to work on a specific part of the website.
